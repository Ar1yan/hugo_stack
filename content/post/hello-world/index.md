My name is Ariyan, and I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and an aspiring penetration tester. 
I got into cybersecurity through tinkering with online game platforms back in middle school, and then life all of a sudden became real once I got to high school. I decided towards the end of junior year that I wanted to become an ethical hacker, and now I’m a pre-junior at Drexel University pursuing this dream. 
I also have a demonstrated history of working within the information technology and security fields, with experience as a security engineer and current information security consultant at a company based in Philadelphia.
